## Project Overview

ImageEnhancerAI is a web application that leverages a deep learning model to enhance low-quality or blurred images into sharp, high-quality versions. Built with Flask and TensorFlow, it provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images, applying AI-based or traditional enhancements, and downloading the results. The system supports user authentication, profile management, and customizable enhancement settings.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Enhancement**: Utilizes a U-Net-based deep learning model trained on paired blurred/sharp datasets.
- **Fallback Enhancement**: Applies traditional image processing (OpenCV-based denoising and sharpening) when the AI model is unavailable.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with session management.
- **Profile Management**: Allows users to update profile pictures and contact information.
- **Customizable Output**: Supports user-defined output sizes and aspect ratio preservation.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for seamless interaction across devices.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Framework**: Flask
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow (U-Net model for image enhancement)
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow (PIL)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, Werkzeug
- **Data Processing**: NumPy

### Frontend

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/99Ahmadprojects/Ai-Image-Enhancer.git
   cd Ai-Image-Enhancer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure the model is placed in the correct directory:

    - Place the trained model (ecom_enhancer.keras) in models/ or provide config.json and model.weights.h5 in models/ecom_enhancer/.
    - If training the model, use the provided Colab notebook and save the model as models/ecom_enhancer.keras.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Methodology
### 1. Image Enhancement Pipeline

- AI Model: A U-Net-based deep learning model trained on paired blurred/sharp images to enhance low-quality inputs.
- Fallback Processing: Uses OpenCV for resizing, denoising, and sharpening when the AI model is unavailable or fails.
- Customization: Users can specify output dimensions and choose to preserve the aspect ratio.

### 2. User Authentication and Profile Management

- Authentication: Secure registration and login using Flask-Login and hashed passwords (Werkzeug).
- Profile Settings: Users can upload profile pictures and update contact information, stored in SQLite.


## Implementation Details
### Image Enhancement

- **Preprocessing:** Images are loaded, resized, and normalized for model input.
- **Model Inference:** The U-Net model processes images to produce enhanced outputs in [0,1] range.
- **Fallback Processing:** If the model fails, OpenCV applies bicubic resizing, bilateral filtering, and unsharp masking.
- **Output Handling:** Enhanced images are saved as JPEG (or PNG for transparency) and served via Flaskâ€™s static folder.

### Web Interface

- **Dashboard:** Allows image uploads, enhancement settings, and displays results with download links.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability on various devices using CSS and JavaScript.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Model Output Range:**

    Handled varying model output ranges (e.g., [0,255], [-1,1]) by adding normalization in the inference pipeline.


2. **Performance:**

   - Optimized model loading to occur once at startup.
   - Used efficient image processing with OpenCV for fallback enhancement.


3. **File Management:**

    Ensured robust path handling for user uploads and database storage across platforms (Windows/Linux).


4. **User Experience:**

    Implemented clear feedback (flash messages) for enhancement success or failure.



## Results

- **Enhancement Quality:** High-quality outputs from the AI model, with fallback processing for reliability.
- **User Experience:** Intuitive interface with secure authentication and profile management.
- **Performance:** Fast image processing and responsive web interface.
